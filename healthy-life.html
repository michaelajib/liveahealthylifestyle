    <h3>1. Bowtrol Probiotics:</h3>
    <p>Probiotics are bacteria that are found in your digestive tract and help your body to absorb nutrients and fight infections. In the past, humans had an abundance of probiotics in our diets because the food we ate was either fresh or fermented to keep it from spoiling. However, this isn’t the case anymore. Dangerous food production techniques like soaking our foods with chlorine, means our foods contain little to no probiotics these days. In fact, most foods actually contain dangerous antibiotics that destroy good bacteria.</p>
    <p>If you’re going to restore your digestive health system, you must replenish the probiotics these killers have to be 
    destroyed. If you don’t, your gut micro-organisms will become imbalanced, and your digestive system becomes a breeding ground for bad bacteria, yeast, viruses, fungi and parasites. To stop this from happening, you’re going to need an effective probiotic supplement to restore the balance of your digestive system.</p>
    <p>Bowtrol probiotics helps to maintain your digestive tracts and also promote your immune system.</p>
